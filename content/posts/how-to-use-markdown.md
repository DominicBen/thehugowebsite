### Learn How to Use Markdown :grin:

Markdown is a plaintext language that allows users to create HTML-like webpages without writing any code.  
These files are simple and easy to write, making them perfect for blogs, personal websites, cookbooks, and even manifestos!

---

## Bold

To make text **bold**, simply surround the word or phrase with double asterisks `**`.

```markdown
Here is an **example**
```

## Italics

To *italicize* text, wrap the word or phrase in underscores `_`.

```markdown
very _simple_
```

very _simple_

You can also **combine** bold and italics:

```markdown
**_Like this_**
```

**_Like this_**

## Headers

Headers are used to organize your content into sections.

```markdown
# Header 1 (Largest)
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6 (Smallest)
```

# Header 1 (Largest)  
## Header 2  
### Header 3  
#### Header 4  
##### Header 5  
###### Header 6 (Smallest)

## Divider

Add a divider using three hyphens on a single line:

```markdown
---
```

---

## Hyperlinks

Inline hyperlinks are created using square brackets for the text and parentheses for the URL:

```markdown
[Check out my website](https://javeronis.com)
```

[Check out my website](https://javeronis.com)

## Images

Images are similar to links but start with an exclamation mark:

```markdown
![A pretty tiger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tiger.50.jpg)
```

![A pretty tiger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tiger.50.jpg)

## Block Quotes

Create block quotes by using the greater-than symbol `>`:

```markdown
> "To be or not to be, that is the question."
```

> "To be or not to be, that is the question."

---

## Code Blocks

To make a code block, indent the line with four spaces:

```plaintext
    It's that simple
```

Or use three backticks (```) or tildes (~~~) to enclose multiple lines:

```markdown
~~~
kind of  
like  
this  
~~~
```

~~~
kind of  
like  
this  
~~~

You can also highlight inline code using backticks:

```markdown
`inline code`
```

## Lists

Lists are simple—use an asterisk `*` for bullet points:

```markdown
* Bread
* Cheese
* 8mL of demon blood
* Butter
   * Mayonnaise works too
```

* Bread  
* Cheese  
* 8mL of demon blood  
* Butter  
   * Mayonnaise works too

For numbered lists, use numbers followed by a period:

```markdown
1. Tetris
2. Minecraft
3. Shrek 2 for the Game Boy
4. God
5. Tetris
```

1. Tetris  
2. Minecraft  
3. Shrek 2 for the Game Boy :sunglasses:  
4. God  
5. Tetris

## Emojis

You can use emojis by wrapping their shortcode between colons:

```markdown
:+1:
```

:+1:

---

## A Note on Newlines

By default, Markdown won't start a new line just because you hit "Enter."  
To force a new line, add **two spaces** at the end of a line:

```markdown
This is one line.  
This is another.
```

This is one line.  
This is another.
