## ðŸ‘¶ Growing Up

Born and raised in Ohio, I grew up curious about how things worked from electronics to games always tinkering, building, and breaking stuff to learn. I found myself publicly hosting many web and game services from my house, without my parents knowledge, which in hindsight was an OpSec disaster ðŸ˜…. That early fascination eventually led me to pursuing all things computers, and pursue a degree at Ohio University.

## ðŸŽ“ Education

I earned a double major Bachelorâ€™s in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Ohio University, where I developed a foundation in both hardware and software systems. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, where my focus has shifted toward embedded systems, data processing, machine learning, and software infrastructure.

## ðŸš€ Future Work

Iâ€™m seeking full-time opportunities starting in **Fall 2025**. Iâ€™m especially interested in roles that bridge hardware and software such as embedded systems, full-stack applications with device integration, or performance-critical backend systems, that will push my limits and allow me to explore new applications for software engineering.
