### This will teach you how to use Markdown :grin:

Markdown is a plain text language that allows users to create HTML-like webpages without requiring coding.  
These Markdown files are simple and easy to create, making them great for blogs, personal websites, cookbooks, and manifestos alike!


## Bold  
To make a word **bold**, simply surround each side of the word with (**) a double asterisk.

    Here is an **Example**
Here is an **Example**

## Italics  
Similar to bold, surround each side of the word with (_) an underscore.

    very _simple_
very _simple_

These tricks **can also span across multiple words**
To do both at the same time, place asterisks on the outside, and underscores on the inside

    **_Like This_**
**_Like This_**

## Headers

Headers are text of increased size, usually used to denote different sections of a document.

# Header 1 (Largest)
## Header 2 
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6 (Smallest)

## Divider

You can add a divider by placing three hyphens on a single line ---

## Hyperlinks

Inline hyperlinks are simple to create.  
Follow the format [] followed by (), where brackets contain the word, and parentheses contain the URL for the link.

## Images

Images are similar to links; we just preface images with an exclamation mark (!)

## Block Quotes

If you want to create a block quote, you can prefix a string with (>) greater than.

    >"To be or not to be, that is the question"
    
>"To be or not to be, that is the question"

## Code Blocks

Code blocks, which I have been using throughout this document, are written by placing four spaces before a line.

        It’s that simple

    you can also code block multiple lines by using (~~~) three Squiggles

    ~~~
    kind of  
    like  
    this  
    ~~~

    Also, surrounding a string in () single quotes

## Lists

Lists are easy; each item in a line is prefixed with (*) an asterisk.
for sub-bullets, simply add three spaces before the (*)

### Things you need to make a grilled cheese sandwich :weary:

~~~
* Bread
* Cheese
* 8mL of demon blood
* Butter
 * Mayonnaise works too

You can also do numbered lists by prefixing a line with (n.) where n is the number in the list
### five ten games

## Emojis
You can actually use emojis in markdown by placing a special code between two colons (:x:)
:+1::+1:

## A note on newlines

By default, Markdown will not render the next line as a new line.
to fix this, place two spaces at the end of a line, to insert a new line.
now, let’s rewrite this really quick
