### This will teach you how to use Markdown :grin:
Markdown is a plaintext language that allows users to make HTML like webpages with no coding required
These markdown files are simple and easy to make, which make them great for blogs, personal websites, cookbooks, and manifestos alike!


## Bold
to make a word **bold**, Simply surround each side of a word with (**) a double asterisk

    Here is an **Example**
Here is an **Example**

## Italics
Similar to bold, Surround each side of a word with (_) an underscore

    very _simple_
very _simple_

These tricks **can also span across multiple words**
To do both at the same time, place asterisks on the outside, and underscores on the inside

    **_Like This_**
**_Like This_**

## Headers

Headers are text of increased size, usually to denote different sections of a document

# Header 1 (Largest)
## Header 2 
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6 (Smallest)

## Divider

You can add a divider by placing three hyphens on a single line `---`

## Block Quotes

If you want to make a block quote you can prefix a string with (>) greater than

    >"To be or not to be, that is the question"
    
>"To be or not to be, that is the question"

## Code Blocks

Code blocks, which I have been using throughout this paper, are written by placing four spaces before a line

        It’s that simple

    you can also code block multiple lines by using (~~~) three Squiggles

    ~~~
    kind of  
    like  
    this  
    ~~~

    Also, surrounding a string in (`) single quotes

## Lists

Lists are easy, each item in a line is prefixed with (*) an asterisk
for sub-bullets, simply add three spaces before the (*)

### Things you need to make a grilled cheese sandwich :weary:

* Bread
* Cheese

You can also do numbered lists by prefixing a line with (n.) where n is the number in the list

## Emojis
You can actually use emojis in markdown by placing a special code between two colons (:x:)
:+1:`:+1:`

## A note on newlines

by default, markdown will not render the next line to a new line
to fix this, place two spaces at the end of a line, to insert a new line.
now, let’s rewrite this really quick

by default, markdown will not render the next line to a new line  
to fix this, place two spaces at the end of a line, to insert a new line.  


## Congrats
